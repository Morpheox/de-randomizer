# de-randomizer
A Trippy javascript experiment, part of the upload of a series of javascript experiments i did years ago and never published.
Its works by generating a random image, and averaging each pixel to its neighbors each step.
With only that simple rule, a lot of interesting patterns emerge, unique each time.
